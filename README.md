##User
this is a work in progress… don't expect a working version in the following weeks. But if you want to test it, try the [latest release](http://github.com/PixelStereo/lekture/releases/latest). There is builds for OSX and for Linux.
OSX version should work on OS X.6 and later. Linux version is made on a Ubuntu 14.04 but has never been tested.
