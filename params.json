Send all the commands you want to all devices/applications you have. It give you a fine-grain control over your needs\r\n\r\n### Work in Progress\r\nThe development of this software has just been began in Dec. 2015. So it's quite young and should not be used in Production before its first release, which is planned sometime in 2016.\r\nThe first release will be limited in term of features, but we want to increment each new feature  when the previous one will be fully functionnal and bug-free.\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@PixelStereo produced this software.
